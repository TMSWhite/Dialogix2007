9/25/2007

Re-commented all Evidence code so that only TricepsTimingCalculator is called:

Errors
(1) RawData not updated
(2) EnglishFrenchDemo not updated
(3) InstrumentSession not updated
(4) PageHitEvents - only partially updated
(5) PageHit updated, but wrong times

Instrument_Session_ID is 0 before most errors

Updates do occur (enough? - compare to without comments) - is problem just session ID?

-----
9/26/2007

data.MysqlInstrumentSessionDAO->setInstrumentSession:63 - instrument_id = 0 - is that session? instrument?

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files show proper Unicode (whether using UTF-16 or UTF-8)
(4) .dat.evt are wrong - JavaScript 1.2 (the version I was using) does not support Unicode. When I declare JavaScript 1.5, no change
(5) Need to test Mysql drivers for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
(6) Entering UTF-8 into any input field (text, memo) yields wrong answer.  Unicode in non-text fieds is fine, but may be due to using internal coded values in return statements

Database Writing
- Seems to be largely fixed (no NullPointerException; one row per desired session; updates are happening)
- However, there are many wrong or missing values which need to be corrected
- Make sure to CVS this before doing much more!

Unicode
- UTF-16 to Log4J let me see some contents correctly, confirming that error is not on Log4J side

Notes from running the Gary's revised code

(1) EnglishRussianFrenchHebrew
(2) InstrumentSession
(3) PageHitEvents
(4) PageHits
(5) RawData

-- Note, can't use on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on two rows, so application must enforce accurate start and end times.
-- N.B.  Focus on InstrumentSession, InstrumentSessionData, and RawData - Ignore PageHits and PageHitEvents for now!!!!

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files OK
(4) .dat.evt files OK
(5) Entering unicode (Russian, Hebrew) into Dialogix data entry fields yields expected value - SO, Sufficiently working?
(6) Test jar/unjar of data - OK
(7) Test jar/unjar of instruments - BAD - when restore, the character values are wrong (but can avoid this by forcing use of .txt files
[ ] Test Mysql for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
[ ] Log4J not showing unicode?

---
10/16/2007

Removed obsolete DB access parameters, interfaces and Beans (now 72 files)
Added DisplayNum to InstrumentSession and InstrumentSessionData tables

---

Critical ToDos
==TOM==
[ ] Finish persisting of full model from DialogixTimingCalculator
  [DONE] Horizontal Table 
  [DONE] DataElement - created, but not updated - do I need to add new objects?  Change persistence type? -- Check that data are being added -- also fix InstrumentContent_ID
  [DONE] PageUsage?
  [DONE] PageUsageEvents?
  [DONE] ItemUsage - fix InstrumentContent_ID
[DONE] Fix uniqueness constraints for Instrument, InstrumentVersion -- Annotate for George
[DONE] Create Inst_Ver_x table wheen upload a new InstrumentVersion (manually roll query) --in ExcelLoader
[DONE] Fix Sequence_Generator so only refers to tables being updated (e.g. remove InstVer4) -- do last 
[ ] Fix? uniqueness for Item, Question, Answer since LOINC mappings will occur at that level -- annotate for George
[ ] HL7 writer (minimal of 2.5, which can be hand-rolled from DataElement)- template for George
[ ] Financial questions - # NH, #staff each, salary of each, %having EMR/PHR.  What about coders for other CMS instruments?  Waste/fraud?
[ ] What happens with DB if there are errors - do I need to modularize error reporting and link to Excel?  OR, only upload to database if finalized  (and use that instead of JAR) -- SKIP?
[ ] Upload larger set of instruments for testing purposes
[DONE] Complete round-trip - upload Excel, collect data - both using JPA -- so populate ItemContents, etc. from Global Definition -- test that can load  instrument and populate DialogixTimingCalculator from InstrumentVersion ID
[ ] Why am I getting NullPointerException on second instrument load?
[ ] Assign AnswerID to result if  applicable (data_element and item_usage)
[ ] Consider re-naming classes?
  - InstrumentContents => Acts
  - ItemType => ActType
  - Item => Act
  - AnswerListContent => AnswerListEntry
[DONE] Re-do Entities to
  - Remove Inst_Ver_4
  - Add ConcatenatedAnswerList to Item - makes it easier to diplay output

Test Instruments
c:\bin\tomcat6\webapps\Demos6\WEB-INF\schedules\DISC-combined.xls -- throws NullPointer - why?
c:\bin\tomcat6\webapps\Demos6\WEB-INF\schedules\English-Russian-French-Hebrew-Demo.xls	-- works
c:\bin\tomcat6\webapps\Demos6\WEB-INF\schedules\PHQ.xls -- NO - throws NullPointer
c:\bin\tomcat6\webapps\Demos6\WEB-INF\schedules\SF-36.xls -- throws NullPointer -- are the questions too long?
c:\bin\tomcat6\webapps\Demos6\WEB-INF\schedules\Test.xls -- works
c:\bin\tomcat6\webapps\Demos6\WEB-INF\schedules\Test2.xls -- NO - NullPointer (after success with EnglishHebrew and Test.xls)

==GEORGE=
[ ] Apelon export (put data into their model and make sure can load it)
[ ] Apelon indexing - ensure can do word-level indexing for searching purposes (ask Jack if can't find it quickly)
[ ] Apelon import (TQL? into format needed by SemanticMapping tables?)
[ ] CCD Writer using SNOMED mapping codes
[ ] GUI for tasks related to Tutorial
[ ] GUI to show uploaded instruments and select from them to load an instrument

Optional Tasks
[ ] Map to XForms
[ ] Map to VoiceXML
[ ] Review Rachel Richesson's LOINC recommendations
[ ] Review ISO 11179 metadata issues - should any be  added to what we have?
[ ] 

Lingering WishList
[ ] Stress testing? (to profile for potential leaks?)
[ ] What will it take to replace current Dialogix install with new one (on www.dialogix.org)?
[ ] Replace wave6users table? (Study - user, instrument - will then point to InstrumentSession?)
[ ] Add prefix to _dlx_ variable names to avoid name clashes?
[ ] Fix issue with language setting so that default is properly recorded.  Can it start in Hebrew?
[ ] Fix Timing information
	[ ] pageHits.FromGroup (always 0)	// consider just using AboutGroupNum (pre-change)? - NO
	[ ] pageHits.totalDuration (always 0)
	[ ] pageHits.loadDuration (always 0)
	[ ] pageHits.networkDuration (seems too high - probably because missing total & load)
	[ ] rawData.itemVascillation
	[ ] rawData.responseLatency
	[ ] rawData.responseDuration
	[ ] rawData.nullFlavor
[ ] In-line JPA and PageHitBean into DialogixTimingCalculator
[ ] Extract DB parameters so can be configured at run-time	
[ ] What is lift to remove Datum and use DataElement within Parser?
[ ] Can data be properly re-loaded to resume a session state?

== MDS Info
==
(1) On average, there are 2 MDS coordinators per Nursing Home
(2) There are between 16K and 17K nursing homes (was it thousand, or hundred)?
(3) If each coordinator makes $50K, then total cost of that staffing is 30k * 1650 * 2 - so $99 million (or 990 million) spent on that role which could be re-directed to care.

== Notes and ToDos from 11/5/07
==
[ ] Outline Tutorial to identify gaps
 - Identify all use cases I want to show
 - Ensure I cover everything listed in the prospectus
 - Now that I know that Items won't be unique, how do I modify the demo? 
[DONE - see below] Assess what works/doesn't in Dialogix -  esp. re: uniqueness
[ ] Map  Abt instruments to Dialogix so can load them
[ ] Create DB-free version for uploading and testing.  Once all syntax errors removed, then upload to DB (extract prior version of ExcelLoader as new class)
[ ] Map to XForms?
[ ] Review eDCI model?
[ ] Review ISO 11179 attributes
[ ] Review Rachel Richesson's data
[ ] Create and test Apelon model
[ ] Verify how will re-import mappings into Dialogix

== NOTES on Import Issues
[ ] Want to re-use Items - how do I know if it the same as an existing one? - ParseItem passing all needed parameters? -- SKIP- too hard for now
	parseQuestion()?	- need a new ID if none exists; but re-use it if possible
	parseAnswer()? - need a new ID if none exists; but re-use it possible - this assumes that if additional languages are added, the user put thought into proper translation; but this may not be true.
	parseAnswerList() - should be global
	parseItem(Question, ...) - should be global
	parseInstrumentContent() -- NO, these don't need to be unique?
	[ ] Modeling problem - should AnswerListContent be unique, or re-used within AnswerLists?  I can't currently detect unique AnswerLists
	I'm not re-using Items - needs to be fixed, but when?
[ ] Extra AnswerLists being created  -- only needed if there is one.  The  problem is that NULL should be allowed within Item (not currently)
[DONE] I may have messed up the unique question/answer constraints - if language specific, they need to be language-specific hashMaps?
	
[ ] What happens if I try to load  Excel with DB turned off?	-- Can I just retrieve a prior version of Excel Loader, re-name it, and  give DB vs. non-DB loading options?

== NOTES on loading content
[ ] Which instruments Do I want to ensure I can load?

== Instrument Use - Which fields still aren't being set properly?
InstrumentSession.languageCode
DataElement.languageCode
DataElement.Answer_ID - confirm this.  Seems wrong!!!! 
	- This is critical.  TimingCalculator.FindAnswerID.  Works for English-Hebrew, but not for PHQ - why not?  
	- The raw data is correct, but the mapping to AnswerID is wrong
	- Can this be retrieved from elsewhere?
	- Is it not loading referential integrity of AnswerLists properly?
DataElement.ResponseLatency
DataElement.ResponseDuration
DataElement.DisplayNum (set to 1 for  setting Unasked - those should be 0)
DataElement.NullFlavorID (should be  non-zero for UNASKED)
ItemUsage.ItemVacillation
ItemUsage.ResponseLatency
ItemUsage.ResponseDuration
ItemUsage.Answer_ID -- wrong! but same solution as DataElement
PageUsage.FromGroupNum - always 0
Pageusage.pageDuration
Pageusage.pageVacillation

AnswerList - what If I add answer_list_denormalized using Dialogix syntax?  [silly, silly, you're doing it!]

NOTES
(1) Throws no errors and does re-use Items, but too many of them (only first AnswerList ever used)
(2) Content appears to be loaded in memory, but not persisted -- are the wrong objects connected?  Is findItem() mis-aligning them?

== Notes from 11/6/07 ==
Action Items
[ ] Add AuthorizedUsers table to Dialogix5


PHP Views
(0) Upload
	- Upload to Dev - do in Velocity or Java Servlet - need code snipped to attach Uploaded file so get filename to submit to Velocity Macro (or InputExcelLoader)
	- Upload to Prod - same, but to database version of Dialogix
(1) Instruments - by title, version - with descriptive statistics.  
	Min = (instrumentHash.numQuestions - instrumentHash.numTailorings); Max = (instrumentHash.numQuestions)
	Name hyperlink - should launch the instrument (look at parser for launch command)
