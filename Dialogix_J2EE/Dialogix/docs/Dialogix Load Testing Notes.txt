Problems:
(1) Duplicate keys - will JSF help fix this, by minimizing transaction-backed code (application vs. session bean)
(2) Is there a thread safety problem with the parser?  Test is to create new DialogixParser with each new parsing event (rather then re-Init)
(3) Null pointer exceptions for InstrumentVersionID - why?
(4) Will Mysql be more reliable if we use InnoDB instead of MyISAM?  What should really be rolled back?
(5) How well do flat-files work under load
(6) How reliable is JTA table generator under load?  What is recommended solution?
(7) Could we be getting concurrency issues from having static methods?  If so, synchronized might not help

- When writing to flat files, stores exactly the same data as in the database (as long as there are no rollbacks)


Questions
(1) Why would we ever get duplicate key errors with EJB?  Is this a Toplink problem?
(2) Does Toplink need to be told that we're using InnoDB tables?
(3) Is Glassfish V2 UC2 more stable?
(4) How can EJB capture errors like DuplicateKey violation and re-try?
(5) Are there better sequence generators than the Table Generator?
