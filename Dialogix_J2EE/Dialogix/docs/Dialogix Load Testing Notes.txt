Problems:
(2) Is there a thread safety problem with the parser?  Test is to create new DialogixParser with each new parsing event (rather then re-Init) [threw 2 errors]
(5) How well do flat-files work under load
(7) Could we be getting concurrency issues from having static methods?  If so, synchronized might not help

- When writing to flat files, stores exactly the same data as in the database (as long as there are no rollbacks)


Questions
(3) Is Glassfish V2 UC2 more stable?
(4) How can EJB capture errors like DuplicateKey violation and re-try?
