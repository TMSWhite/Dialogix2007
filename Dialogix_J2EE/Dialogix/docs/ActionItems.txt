Optional Tasks
[ ] Map to XForms
[ ] Map to eDCI model
[ ] Map to VoiceXML
[ ] Review ISO 11179 metadata issues - should any be  added to what we have?
[ ] Expose all key SQL queries (see Debugging Notes) from front-end for testing purposes
	- All localized questions for an item
	- All answers and values for items which have AnswerLists
	- All  unique AnswerLists
	- All unique English AnswerLists
	- All questions, answers, and values for items which have answerLists
	- HL7 query (OBX-3, 5, OBR-4)
	- HL7 3.0 query (CCD)
[ ] Contact AHIMA re: workflow used for ASPE project
[ ] Switch to org.dialogix.parser, using Data_Element as base class (since has InstrumentContent information)
[ ] Remove all references to DialogixLogger, ScheduleList, ScheduleSource, ScheduleInfo
[ ] Should I move all DatumMath into Datum?

Lingering WishList
[.] Replace wave6users table? (Study - user, instrument - will then point to InstrumentSession?) - will require review of all special functions within the instrument - NOTE, when loaded it, there were several errors!
	username
	password
	filename =>  session
	instrument => instrument_version
	status => (unstarted, working - really based on session status!)
	startingStep => ?? really part of instrumentVersion?
	_clinpass => ?? really part of instrument?
	Dem1 => should really be a username issue
	lastAccess => delete
	currentStep => delete - part of session
	currentIP => 
	lastAction =>
	sessionID => remove
	browser => 
	statusMsg
	ID
	
	[ ] Can I use this modeling to let me support current approach:
	  - Studies like Wave7
	  - Anonymous ones like CET (list of instruments?)
	  - List of available instruments (anonymous)
	  - List of working instruments
	    - __FILENAME__	- just part of datafile (?) so don't need it as part of instrument_sessions
	 [ ]   - __TITLE_FOR_PICKLIST_WHEN_IN_PROGRESS__ - add this to instrument_sessions?
	  = Study metadata (name, grant, contact, etc.) - like a properties file
	
[. ] What is lift to remove Datum and use DataElement within Parser?
[ ] Upload instruments via Upload button
[ ] Create WriteNode() equivalent which doesn't use legacy Node and Datum elements
[ ] Create Navigation methods which get collection of InstrumentContent for next, previous, etc.
[ ] Can it deploy to Tomcat?
[ ] What about local install (e.g. replace current flat-file model with CSV database - what are implications for Perl code? - StelsCSV JDBC Looks good http://www.csv-jdbc.com/ - I'd probably want to create a new "table" or "tablespace" per instrument session to support that mode? - each JDBC connection would be to a different path for the data collection model (but what are implications for then merging those data back into a centralized database?)
[ ] DataExporter - support export to winzip (requires different source output - open new window with type="application/zip" (what is proper syntax?)


---
Priorities
[ ] Restore from .jar or .dat+.dat.evt combo to load into database
[ ] Google Analytics to track position? (or should it wait for  JSP?) - JSP into Dialogix.jsp (pass certain fields?)
[ ] LoginTricepsServlet - what is lift to run Wave7 off of new models?
[. ] Back-load Wave7 data into new model? - would have to be from working and jar files - Does restore from .jar load everything needed into V1?
[ ] Glassfish on www.dialogix.org:8080, but with multiple instantiations (e.g. does current system work OK under glassfish instead of Tomcat?)
[ ] How do I automate backup of InnoDB database?
[ ] Study Management Front-End
  [ ] Study home page - design DB to store info needed for home page, assuming static location for images (vs. databased)? - e.g. Action=Studies
  [ ] Study-level security of instrument access
  [ ] Load wave6_users into new study tables
  [ ] JSP for Study Manager letting them view completion status of instruments
  [ ] JSP for Clinical Reviewer - view cases needing completion
  [ ] Change suspendToFloppy to use floppy_dir to assign to different study?
[ ] Management Tool
[ ] Securing access to an instrument (e.g. must be signed in and anonymous not allowed?) - e.g. flag whether has errors, and whether deployable

-- 6/24/08 - Dialogix Planning:  What is most CRITICAL to moving forward? --
QUESTIONS
[ ] Is migrating Wave7 to new model REALLY critical, or can I continue with Perl-based approach?  Does Perl approach still work?
  [ ] If Perl-based, does new model write to flat-files correctly, and without re-entrancy?
  [ ] If migrating needed, what is lift to import old data into new model - can it happen from page_usage, page_usage_event, etc; or will it require loading from jar file (model this!)
    - Load .dat file to get variable name hashmap; then load appropriate instrument based upon num_vars and var_list_md5 (as opposed to instrument name)?  May be more complex than this if have duplicate instrument_hash for multiple instruments
    - If  can't find instrument_version, write (to file or DB) source file name, presumed instrument name, # variables, and needed varname hashmap
      - Do I need to fix the duplicate key problem before loading large numbers of historical instruments?  How will that affect mapping and/or running of instrument?
		- See analysis below - loading from .jar, .dat, and .dat.evt looks like most viable option, but will require a bit of coding, and pre-loading of all relevant instruments
		    
[ ] What about support for Hebrew study? - is there a continued need for flat-files?
[ ] What is lift to create transposed tables for export?  There must be a way (PL-SQL?)

MOST CRITICAL NEEDS
[ ] Reliable hosting of CET studies
[ ] Multi-lingual CET data - to export, need way to create denormalized table without requirement to view it:  can SQL do that?  Does it really need to be transposed? (e.g. can SAS or SPSS transpose it?)

CURRENT PROJECTS
[ ] Restore from .jar or .dat+.dat.evt combo to load into database
[ ] LoginTricepsServlet - what is lift to run Wave7 off of new models?
[. ] Back-load Wave7 data into new model? - would have to be from working and jar files - Does restore from .jar load everything needed into V1?
[ ] Glassfish on www.dialogix.org:8080, but with multiple instantiations (e.g. does current system work OK under glassfish instead of Tomcat?)
[ ] How do I automate backup of InnoDB database?

HISTORICAL INSTRUMETNS AND DATA
[ ] Create master list of all instruments, especially those for which data has been collected (so can load to them based upon consistent Hashmap - may require query against RawData tables = see find/regex in DebuggingNotes.txt
	I have 91 instruments in /usr/local/tomwhite/data/instrument (but there are probably more), so load from those
[ ] Recursively find data in directories - TricepsEngine.RESTORE_FROM_FLOPPY has sample
 	
DEPLOY ON LAPTOP
[ ] Will it deploy to Tomcat?  If not, what is gap (e.g. toplink?) (because there is Tomcat hosting (plus Toplink?) pretty 
[ ] Ensure can write to file
	Evidence.writeNode()
	Triceps.DB_WRITE_SYSTEM_FILES
	ScheduleSource.DB_WRITE_SYSTEM_FILES
[ ] Manage files to which data written (e.g. StringBuffer for content to write to each, then one open, write, flush, and close command)
[ ] Manage file location in database
[ ] Use old-style formatting so will work with Perl, (for now, don't use Unicode, but make it easy to switch?)
[ ] Manage schedules - use schedules directory, or require database?
[ ] Ensure I have backup-copy of most recent Dialogix-Laptop source code (the one from Hebrew study?)
 	
MODELING QUESTIONS
	If creating an external interface, call sequence is:
		loadScheduleFromDB (getInstrumentAsSpreadsheet) - to initialze all data_elements and reserved words
  	
  	then for each iteration
  	setLastAction()
  	beginServerProcessing()
  	setLanguageCode()
  	processEvents()
  		writeNode()
  		writeReserved()? - will this happen if a reserved value is changed? How?
  	writeNodePreAsking() - (for all new events - how know what they'll be?)
  		- does this require fixing the parser to interpret next steps manually?
  		- do next() and previous() need to be called for the instrument (tricepsEngine)?
  		- is there work-around for pre-asking (since log files don't have this info)? YES - for each item, call pre-asking then asking AFTER know  list of items to write
  	logBrowserInfo()
  	setToVarNum()
  	finishServerProcessing()
  	
	Note, would also want to log status of loading individual instruments via this ETL process so can roll-back on error (e.g. cascade delete of all session-specific data if load fails)? 	

Non-Critical:
[ ] Move DatumMath into  Datum
[ ] Switch to org.dialogix.parser, using Data_Element as base class (since has InstrumentContent information)
[ ] Remove all references to DialogixLogger, ScheduleList, ScheduleSource, ScheduleInfo
[ ] Replace VersionIF and related @@ variables with loadable properties. - @Resources
[ ] Create WriteNode() equivalent which doesn't use legacy Node and Datum elements
[ ] Create Navigation methods which get collection of InstrumentContent for next, previous, etc.
[ ] DataExporter - support export to winzip (requires different source output - open new window with type="application/zip" (what is proper syntax?)

LOCAL INSTALL
[ ] Can it deploy to Tomcat?
[ ] What about local install (e.g. replace current flat-file model with CSV database - what are implications for Perl code? - StelsCSV JDBC Looks good http://www.csv-jdbc.com/ - I'd probably want to create a new "table" or "tablespace" per instrument session to support that mode? - each JDBC connection would be to a different path for the data collection model (but what are implications for then merging those data back into a centralized database?)
[ ] Re-tests ability to save data to flat files - ideally using JDBC:CVS (so manage configuration via properties - may want to write to both Mysql and CSV - can I use an interceptor to write to both?)

Gap Analysis with production PHP version
(4) Results
  #, SessionID, StartTime, results -- will require changing InstrumentSessionResultBean, or lookup of InstrumentSession via EJB
(5) Recap List (session list)
	StartDate, SessionID, Completed, NumPagesViewed, Duration (hh:mm:ss)	-- duration requires calculation of lastAccessTime - startTime OR sum of all pageDuration events?
(7) VoiceXML

(10)? find all instruments using the same question?

[ ] update role-based access per study
[ ] should anonymous be able to launch instruments without being part of study?
[ ] track logins in table -- via EJB connected to Person?
[ ] update login status in person table; consider merging it each time so can maintain single use token (or just do that at session level)?
[ ] encrypt password used within Person table, and pass encrypted password over wire
[ ] Make "collaborations" dynamic so can see study-specific pages?
[ ] Google analytics to track .jsp site usage
[ ] Google analytics - can I back-date clicks?
[ ] Force all instruments to be associated with a study/context?
[ ] Restrict ability to launch an instrument based upon authenticated  role (right now, servlet-based, so if know URL, can make it work - how embed login fields without messing up laptop deploy?)

--
7/2/08

[ ] Collaborations - just get ArrayList<Study> - possibly sorted
  [ ] add start/end dates?

7/3/08

[ ] have servlet launcher enforce role-based security?  Does it have an entry point into DataExporter?  No, just the facades (which can be made adequate)
[ ] Logistical Dilemma - must load instrument before can assign it to a study
	[ ] dataExporter.instrumentVersions
[ ] Assining instruments to studies - this can get very complicated
  - Instruments which are private to studies
  - You can only assign instruments to your  own studies
[ ] Lock down permissions on extract_raw_data based upon user permissions (or would it be just instruments assigned to that study)?  - getFinalInstrumentSessionResults()
[ ] Assign study wheen launching instrument - so MUST pass studyId and PersonId through to servlet launcher.
[ ] ListStudies bypasses fine-grained access
[ ] Re-write TricepsServlet as JSP?
  RunInstrument - in-lines all; only problem is that output writer points to wrong path (need  Dialogix.jsp?action=RunInstrument&...).

--
7/5/08
--
[ ] for local scoping, what is needed?  Item, Value (should data_elemetn contain ID of last item_usage for rapid lookup (findById instead of navigating collection?)
[ ] Re-brand dataExporter as single InstrumentSessionBean?  Would it be better to manage all in scope of a single bean, or have separate backing beans for each?
[ ] Test use of <fmt:> for dealing with localized messages?
[ ] Have question + answerlist be a block so can do colspan?  If so, could assign each to a <div> or jsf column to ensure that all appear aligned?
[ ] Move error messages to SessionBean (for consistent access)?
[ ] Rather than having JSP determine collection based upon language, let sessionBean do so (that way if change model, don't have to re-write them) - advantage of using collection is processing of SQL queries?
[ ] Need way to set _dlxObjects array with all appropriate varNames and types (including submit?) in dialogix_js.jsp
[ ] What is best way to deal with word-wrap on list and combo-boxes? (requires insertion of additional select elements - like a sub-sub-view?

Priorities
[ ] Data load from JAR
[ ] If move Reserved Word out of InstrumentVersion (e.g. to StudyInstVer), how should dev vs. production instruments be treated?
[ ] Consider new Datum object using data_element.last_item_usage_id.* as source
[ ] Map wave6_users to new model (SQL transformation)


-- 7/9/08  BugFixes Needed
[ ] test whether item.responseLatency & responseDuration are working correctly for IE and Mozilla (test all timing information - still seems off)
[ ] Test equation logic on load?
[ ] instrument_session.current_var_num and current_group - should they be updated pre-asking or post-asking?
[ ] should each equation be a separate group, or be attached to end of prior group?
[ ] Should change in language trigger a page event? and a change in display_count?
[ ] Ensure all parser tests process correctly - especially regex
[ ] when restore, it is  putting value (like *NA*) into text field instead of setting Datum's nullFlavor
[ ] Person being set for started and restored sessions incorrectly - seems to be suffering from having shared objects across the dataExporter session?
[ ] Errors
 - fromGroup
 - toGroup
 - initial server time - too short - should be current beginning to end, not past end to current beginning?

-- 7/14/08
[. ] How would I launch an instrument from SubjectSession and update its keys appropriately?:  ss=# (instead of instrument = X?)
[ ] Need to set starting step for subject_session? - via __STARTING_STEP__? -- ensure it has desired  side-effect
[ ] biggest challenge is dealing with detached entities - cases where I want the menuing system to just do a new query each time vs. dealing with object graphs.

-- 7/16/08
[ ] Finish ability to launch from a subject_session - this will let me understand workflow needed to updated data from .dat and .dat.evt files
[ ] Next focus on loading data from old files
[ ] Then determine how to associate data with a study (since for Wave7, could just do a SQL update for these)
[ ] follow prototype of dataExporter.getDatFileView in reverse to load data?
[ ] BUG - when question skipped, marked as Unasked?  Might be better to have SKIPPED NullFlavor for easier NullFlavor change purposes
[ ] When loading old data, bypass writeNode(), etc. since they set internal timing values - want them explicitly set from data file
[ ] BUG - wrong timing information? - may be a DateTime (to second level) vs. millisecond (timestamp)? issue
[ ] Load from .jar - detect Unicode vs. not by whether first token is RESERVED?
[ ] Loading data from .jar - need to initially split file into multiple sources if needed
[ ] Note, the millisecond portion of the Date fields are not being preserved.  Do I need them, vs. converting all Date storage to Long  (for ms)? - would that make duration calculations easier?

-- 7/17/08
[ ] Map values from .dat and .dat.evt to workflow to store them - may identify any lingering modeling issues?

Trizetto

-- 7/21/08
[ ] www.dialogix.org keeps throwing UnexectedError - Rollback for large instruments - try preventing rollback so can see how far it got?
[ ] Don't increment display count when marking elements as NA?
[ ] Should use of Admin mode trigger a page event?
[ ] Events don't seem to be attached to icons and buttons - a javascript and _dlxObjects issue? (initial attempt threw bugs)

-- I'm confused, now when I set PersonId, the tables are properly updated via new query - wny not before?  Is this a safe method?
SELECT 
	iss.instrument_version_id,
	iv.instrument_id,
	i.instrument_name,

[ ] Could the issue with lack of synchronicity be due to separate entity managers?

[ ] Configure Perl directories for her too?
[ ] Diff code to see what major changes have been made to J2EE which should be back-ported to 2995
