Optional Tasks
[ ] Map to XForms
[ ] Map to eDCI model
[ ] Map to VoiceXML
[ ] Review ISO 11179 metadata issues - should any be  added to what we have?
[ ] Expose all key SQL queries (see Debugging Notes) from front-end for testing purposes
[ ] Contact AHIMA re: workflow used for ASPE project
[ ] Switch to org.dialogix.parser, using Data_Element as base class (since has InstrumentContent information)
[ ] Can RawData tables be processed to load instruments into new model (e.g. Perl-ify everything first, then process resulting Db, rather than Perl straight to new model?)
[ ] Remove all references to DialogixLogger, ScheduleList, ScheduleSource, ScheduleInfo

Lingering WishList
[.] Replace wave6users table? (Study - user, instrument - will then point to InstrumentSession?) - will require review of all special functions within the instrument - NOTE, when loaded it, there were several errors!
	username
	password
	filename =>  session
	instrument => instrument_version
	status => (unstarted, working - really based on session status!)
	startingStep => ?? really part of instrumentVersion?
	_clinpass => ?? really part of instrument?
	Dem1 => should really be a username issue
	lastAccess => delete
	currentStep => delete - part of session
	currentIP => 
	lastAction =>
	sessionID => remove
	browser => 
	statusMsg
	ID
	
	[ ] Can I use this modeling to let me support current approach:
	  - Studies like Wave7
	  - Anonymous ones like CET (list of instruments?)
	  - List of available instruments (anonymous)
	  - List of working instruments
	    - __FILENAME__	- just part of datafile (?) so don't need it as part of instrument_sessions
	    - __TITLE_FOR_PICKLIST_WHEN_IN_PROGRESS__ - add this to instrument_sessions?
	  = Study metadata (name, grant, contact, etc.) - like a properties file
	
	Group:
	id
	group_name
	location
	
	Study:
	id
	study_name
	study_icon
	support_phone
	support_email
	support_name
	pi_name
	grant_name
	group_id
	
	Subject:
	id
	username
	password
	study_id
	instrument_version_id
	session_id
	
	Subject_Data:
	id
	subject_id
	var_name
	value
	
	-- if so, create tables then let NetBeans build EJB from source?
[ ] What is lift to remove Datum and use DataElement within Parser?
[ ] Create master list of all instruments, especially those for which data has been collected (so can load to them based upon consistent Hashmap - may require query against RawData tables = see find/regex in DebuggingNotes.txt
[ ] Replace VersionIF and related @@ variables with loadable properties. - @Resources
[ ] Call ApelonExporter from front-end (not just on-load) - consider storing results in database column
[ ] Assess "Mismatch across languages" errors - sign of imporper normalization? - will want to know ID of of AnswerList which is trying to be reset
[. ] Model extra tables for study management
[. ] Add AuthorizedUsers table to Dialogix5
[ ] Upload instruments via Upload button
[ ] Create WriteNode() equivalent which doesn't use legacy Node and Datum elements
[ ] Create Navigation methods which get collection of InstrumentContent for next, previous, etc.
[ ] Replace all workflow with JSP pointing to new model
[ ] Can it deploy to Tomcat?
[ ] What about local install (e.g. replace current flat-file model with CSV database - what are implications for Perl code? - StelsCSV JDBC Looks good http://www.csv-jdbc.com/ - I'd probably want to create a new "table" or "tablespace" per instrument session to support that mode? - each JDBC connection would be to a different path for the data collection model (but what are implications for then merging those data back into a centralized database?)
[ ] DataExporter - support export to winzip (requires different source output - open new window with type="application/zip" (what is proper syntax?)
[ ] test whether item.responseLatency & responseDuration are working correctly for IE and Mozilla (test all timing information - still seems off)
[ ] Identify problem with duplicate entries in AnswerList (and others)?
[ ] Manage logins (try using PHP model with cookies?)
[ ] Re-tests ability to save data to flat files - ideally using JDBC:CVS (so manage configuration via properties - may want to write to both Mysql and CSV - can I use an interceptor to write to both?)


Bugs
[B ] Once a data element is flagged as missing a required value, it never resets itself even if have entered proper response
[ ] Assess "Mismatch across languages" errors - sign of imporper normalization? - will want to know ID of of AnswerList which is trying to be reset
[B ] Validate restore - both to full model, and also to internal Schedule, Node, etc. locations

Priorities
[ ] LoginTricepsServlet - what is lift to run Wave7 off of new models?
[ ] Google Analytics to track position?
[ ] JSF vs. JSP to finish work - which will be easier to maintain (e.g. add login capabilities to JSP?)
[ ] Memory leak? - may be worse in V2 model since multiple pointers to same contents (data_elements and item_usages both point to instrument_content)
[. ] What is lift to back-load Wave7 data into new model? - would have to be from working and jar files - Does restore from .jar load everything needed into V1?
[ ] Can static and dynamic models be decoupled from Toplink perspective?  Most criticcal (?) to decouple data_elements and/or item_ussages from instrument_contents to avoid duplicate load of them?
[ ] Do I really need answer0, comment0?  Nice, but is there another, convenient way?  I believe the motivation was to see 2
[ ] Review Struts or related model instead of JSF?
[ ] Do we really need VarName ID instead of Variable Name (indexed)?  Advantage of using IDs is that it allows for case-sensitive search, and avoidance of naming length problems
[ ] Glassfish on www.dialogix.org:8080, but with multiple instantiations (e.g. does current system work OK under glassfish instead of Tomcat?)

---
Functions listed within Wave7 - so this is OK other than suspendToFloppy
isNA()
__FILENAME__
__TITLE_FOR_PICKLIST_WHEN_IN_PROGRESS__
count()
suspendToFlopppy(NDconfirm_subject);	// where does this put things - could I just declare the "suspend" or "archive" directory as a new domainspace?  If so, must search just in that space - Presently, this is ignored
list()
desc()
getAnsOption()

---
Value of having answer_code0, answer_string0, comments0 - so enough value that worth keeping unless it clearly hurts performance
(1) Instead, used null_flavor_change - need to re-design it so that can query separately on source and destination values.  Also need to know whether Ok2Ok represents a changed value!
(2) slice transitions by language, date, instrument, question
(3) count # of transitions and types by user, instrument, etc.


-- Debugging from Merged V1/V2 Model (6/17/2008) --
[ ] pageUsage errors
	[ ] first page_usage row should say from_group 0 to_group 1 (now 1=>1)
	[ ] page_visit wrong
[ ] Need nullFlavorChange which indicates whether the value really changed in an Ok2Ok situtation?

[ ] Will restore be able to re-create the internally used  data structures, or am I forced to re-populate nodes, datums, schedule, and evidence from the database?  If so, what is lift to re-creating presentation layer from JSP and EJB?
[ ] instrument_session.current_var_num and current_group - should they be updated pre-asking or post-asking?
[ ] Should half of page usage be written pre-asking?
[ ] Should change in language trigger a page event?
[ ] setCurrentGroup - start with 0 for session?
[ ] Do I really need IP address and browser for both page_usage and instrument_session?
[ ] What happens to data from sessions which are missing starting values?  Will I see "UNASKED?" = this is a JSP issue, not core to the model
