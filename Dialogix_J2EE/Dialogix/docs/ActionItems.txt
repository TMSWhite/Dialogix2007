Optional Tasks
[ ] Map to XForms
[ ] Map to eDCI model
[ ] Map to VoiceXML
[ ] Review ISO 11179 metadata issues - should any be  added to what we have?
[ ] Expose all key SQL queries (see Debugging Notes) from front-end for testing purposes
[ ] Contact AHIMA re: workflow used for ASPE project
[ ] Switch to org.dialogix.parser, using Data_Element as base class (since has InstrumentContent information)
[ ] Remove all references to DialogixLogger, ScheduleList, ScheduleSource, ScheduleInfo
[ ] Should I move all DatumMath into Datum?

Lingering WishList
[.] Replace wave6users table? (Study - user, instrument - will then point to InstrumentSession?) - will require review of all special functions within the instrument - NOTE, when loaded it, there were several errors!
	username
	password
	filename =>  session
	instrument => instrument_version
	status => (unstarted, working - really based on session status!)
	startingStep => ?? really part of instrumentVersion?
	_clinpass => ?? really part of instrument?
	Dem1 => should really be a username issue
	lastAccess => delete
	currentStep => delete - part of session
	currentIP => 
	lastAction =>
	sessionID => remove
	browser => 
	statusMsg
	ID
	
	[ ] Can I use this modeling to let me support current approach:
	  - Studies like Wave7
	  - Anonymous ones like CET (list of instruments?)
	  - List of available instruments (anonymous)
	  - List of working instruments
	    - __FILENAME__	- just part of datafile (?) so don't need it as part of instrument_sessions
	 [ ]   - __TITLE_FOR_PICKLIST_WHEN_IN_PROGRESS__ - add this to instrument_sessions?
	  = Study metadata (name, grant, contact, etc.) - like a properties file
	
[. ] What is lift to remove Datum and use DataElement within Parser?
[ ] Create master list of all instruments, especially those for which data has been collected (so can load to them based upon consistent Hashmap - may require query against RawData tables = see find/regex in DebuggingNotes.txt
[ ] Replace VersionIF and related @@ variables with loadable properties. - @Resources
[X] Assess "Mismatch across languages" errors - sign of imporper normalization? - will want to know ID of of AnswerList which is trying to be reset - seems to only affect hebrew?  Much rarer now that all InnoDB
	- LOOKS OK:
		 SELECT *
		FROM instrument_load_error
		WHERE error_message LIKE '%already has AnswerId%'
		
		 SELECT *
		FROM instrument_load_error
		WHERE error_message LIKE '%Mismatch across languages%'		
		
		 SELECT *
		FROM answer_list_content alc, answer_list_denorm ald
		WHERE alc.answer_id IN ( 1, 2 )
		AND alc.answer_list_id = ald.answer_list_id;	
		
		-- So, what is triggering that error message?  Could it be wrong?
[ ] Upload instruments via Upload button
[ ] Create WriteNode() equivalent which doesn't use legacy Node and Datum elements
[ ] Create Navigation methods which get collection of InstrumentContent for next, previous, etc.
[ ] Can it deploy to Tomcat?
[ ] What about local install (e.g. replace current flat-file model with CSV database - what are implications for Perl code? - StelsCSV JDBC Looks good http://www.csv-jdbc.com/ - I'd probably want to create a new "table" or "tablespace" per instrument session to support that mode? - each JDBC connection would be to a different path for the data collection model (but what are implications for then merging those data back into a centralized database?)
[ ] DataExporter - support export to winzip (requires different source output - open new window with type="application/zip" (what is proper syntax?)
[ ] test whether item.responseLatency & responseDuration are working correctly for IE and Mozilla (test all timing information - still seems off)


---
Priorities
[ ] Restore from .jar or .dat+.dat.evt combo to load into database
[ ] Google Analytics to track position? (or should it wait for  JSP?) - JSP into Dialogix.jsp (pass certain fields?)
[ ] LoginTricepsServlet - what is lift to run Wave7 off of new models?
[. ] Back-load Wave7 data into new model? - would have to be from working and jar files - Does restore from .jar load everything needed into V1?
[ ] Glassfish on www.dialogix.org:8080, but with multiple instantiations (e.g. does current system work OK under glassfish instead of Tomcat?)
[ ] How do I automate backup of InnoDB database?
[ ] Study Management Front-End
  [ ] Study home page - design DB to store info needed for home page, assuming static location for images (vs. databased)? - e.g. Action=Studies
  [ ] Study-level security of instrument access
  [ ] Load wave6_users into new study tables
  [ ] JSP for Study Manager letting them view completion status of instruments
  [ ] JSP for Clinical Reviewer - view cases needing completion
  [ ] Change suspendToFloppy to use floppy_dir to assign to different study?
[ ] Management Tool
[ ] Securing access to an instrument (e.g. must be signed in and anonymous not allowed?) - e.g. flag whether has errors, and whether deployable
[ ] Test equation logic on load?

[ ] JSF vs. JSP to finish work - which will be easier to maintain (e.g. add login capabilities to JSP?)
  - Note, Netbeans JsfJpaCRUD example shows that introspection can work for JPA - but what needed to be done to get it there?
  - ditto - does NOT use  annoying GET URLs - how was that configured? - does have annoying function strings within HTML, but not exposed on GET
  - use of DataTable is lightweight - doesn't require expensive Woodstock overlay!
  - does show how to paginate results, but how? (also not using JSF-style cached data providers - instead a table-by-table controller?)
    - em queries let you setFirstResult() and setMaxResults()
  - jMaki uses JSON syntax and data providers (via JSP with in-lined Java (odd)) to support dynamic action - would this be valuable?
  - for JSF, has nice way of getting request parameters within Java (don't need it in JSP at all?):  String param = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().get("purchaseOrderId");
  - can have wildcard in <faces-config><navigation-rule><from-outcomes>*</from-outcome><to-view-id>xxxx.jsp</to-view-id></navigation-rule></faces-config>
  - need to test nested sub-views and data accessors in small scale test before going full-force towards JSF.
[ ] pageUsage:  first page_usage row should say from_group 0 to_group 1 (now 1=>1)
[ ] Pageuage:  page_visit wrong; ditto, pageUsage.timeStamp - should be when view started, not stopped
[ ] Need nullFlavorChange which indicates whether the value really changed in an Ok2Ok situtation?
[ ] instrument_session.current_var_num and current_group - should they be updated pre-asking or post-asking?
[ ] Should change in language trigger a page event? and a change in display_count?
[ ] Ensure all parser tests process correctly - especially regex

-- 6/24/08 - Dialogix Planning:  What is most CRITICAL to moving forward? --
QUESTIONS
[ ] Is migrating Wave7 to new model REALLY critical, or can I continue with Perl-based approach?  Does Perl approach still work?
  [ ] If Perl-based, does new model write to flat-files correctly, and without re-entrancy?
  [ ] If migrating needed, what is lift to import old data into new model - can it happen from page_usage, page_usage_event, etc; or will it require loading from jar file (model this!)
    - Load .dat file to get variable name hashmap; then load appropriate instrument based upon num_vars and var_list_md5 (as opposed to instrument name)?  May be more complex than this if have duplicate instrument_hash for multiple instruments
    - If  can't find instrument_version, write (to file or DB) source file name, presumed instrument name, # variables, and needed varname hashmap
      - Do I need to fix the duplicate key problem before loading large numbers of historical instruments?  How will that affect mapping and/or running of instrument?
		- See analysis below - loading from .jar, .dat, and .dat.evt looks like most viable option, but will require a bit of coding, and pre-loading of all relevant instruments
		    
[ ] What about support for Hebrew study? - is there a continued need for flat-files?
[ ] What is lift to create transposed tables for export?  There must be a way (PL-SQL?)

MOST CRITICAL NEEDS
[ ] Reliable hosting of CET studies
[ ] Multi-lingual CET data - to export, need way to create denormalized table without requirement to view it:  can SQL do that?  Does it really need to be transposed? (e.g. can SAS or SPSS transpose it?)
[ ] Loading of .jar files into DB (but always do from .jar files)?

CURRENT PROJECTS
[ ] test whether item.responseLatency & responseDuration are working correctly for IE and Mozilla (test all timing information - still seems off)
[ ] Restore from .jar or .dat+.dat.evt combo to load into database
[ ] LoginTricepsServlet - what is lift to run Wave7 off of new models?
[. ] Back-load Wave7 data into new model? - would have to be from working and jar files - Does restore from .jar load everything needed into V1?
[ ] Glassfish on www.dialogix.org:8080, but with multiple instantiations (e.g. does current system work OK under glassfish instead of Tomcat?)
[ ] How do I automate backup of InnoDB database?

HISTORICAL INSTRUMETNS AND DATA
[ ] Create master list of all instruments, especially those for which data has been collected (so can load to them based upon consistent Hashmap - may require query against RawData tables = see find/regex in DebuggingNotes.txt
	I have 91 instruments in /usr/local/tomwhite/data/instrument (but there are probably more), so load from those
[ ] Recursively find data in directories - TricepsEngine.RESTORE_FROM_FLOPPY has sample
 	
DEPLOY ON LAPTOP
[ ] Will it deploy to Tomcat?  If not, what is gap (e.g. toplink?) (because there is Tomcat hosting (plus Toplink?) pretty 
[ ] Ensure can write to file
	Evidence.writeNode()
	Triceps.DB_WRITE_SYSTEM_FILES
	ScheduleSource.DB_WRITE_SYSTEM_FILES
[ ] Manage files to which data written (e.g. StringBuffer for content to write to each, then one open, write, flush, and close command)
[ ] Manage file location in database
[ ] Use old-style formatting so will work with Perl, (for now, don't use Unicode, but make it easy to switch?)
[ ] Manage schedules - use schedules directory, or require database?
[ ] Ensure I have backup-copy of most recent Dialogix-Laptop source code (the one from Hebrew study?)
 	
MODELING QUESTIONS
	If creating an external interface, call sequence is:
		loadScheduleFromDB (getInstrumentAsSpreadsheet) - to initialze all data_elements and reserved words
  	
  	then for each iteration
  	setLastAction()
  	beginServerProcessing()
  	setLanguageCode()
  	processEvents()
  		writeNode()
  		writeReserved()? - will this happen if a reserved value is changed? How?
  	writeNodePreAsking() - (for all new events - how know what they'll be?)
  		- does this require fixing the parser to interpret next steps manually?
  		- do next() and previous() need to be called for the instrument (tricepsEngine)?
  		- is there work-around for pre-asking (since log files don't have this info)? YES - for each item, call pre-asking then asking AFTER know  list of items to write
  	logBrowserInfo()
  	setToVarNum()
  	finishServerProcessing()
  	
	Note, would also want to log status of loading individual instruments via this ETL process so can roll-back on error (e.g. cascade delete of all session-specific data if load fails)? 	

Non-Critical:
[ ] Move DatumMath into  Datum
[ ] Switch to org.dialogix.parser, using Data_Element as base class (since has InstrumentContent information)
[ ] Remove all references to DialogixLogger, ScheduleList, ScheduleSource, ScheduleInfo
[ ] Replace VersionIF and related @@ variables with loadable properties. - @Resources
[ ] Create WriteNode() equivalent which doesn't use legacy Node and Datum elements
[ ] Create Navigation methods which get collection of InstrumentContent for next, previous, etc.
[ ] DataExporter - support export to winzip (requires different source output - open new window with type="application/zip" (what is proper syntax?)

LOCAL INSTALL
[ ] Can it deploy to Tomcat?
[ ] What about local install (e.g. replace current flat-file model with CSV database - what are implications for Perl code? - StelsCSV JDBC Looks good http://www.csv-jdbc.com/ - I'd probably want to create a new "table" or "tablespace" per instrument session to support that mode? - each JDBC connection would be to a different path for the data collection model (but what are implications for then merging those data back into a centralized database?)
[ ] Re-tests ability to save data to flat files - ideally using JDBC:CVS (so manage configuration via properties - may want to write to both Mysql and CSV - can I use an interceptor to write to both?)

6/25/08
--
[ ] check all setReserveds for side-effects
[ ] some setReserveds should set values in the data model - e.g. title_for_picklist
[ ] when restore, it is  putting value (like *NA*) into text field instead of setting Datum's nullFlavor

[ ] Restore not working for equations?

--
6/30/08
--
[ ] update role-based access per study
[ ] should anonymous be able to launch instruments without being part of study?
[ ] when finish an instrument, it invalidates the session, so have to re-login - is that what I want?
[ ] track logins in table
[ ] update login status in person table; consider merging it each time so can maintain single use token (or just do that at session level)?
[ ] add MySessions - list of data I collected
[ ] encrypt password used within Person table, and pass encrypted password over wire
[ ] Make "collaborations" dynamic so can see study-specific pages?
[ ] Page title
[ ] track down bug in logic file
[ ] Add User role which lets them work with instruments?
[ ] Google analytics to track .jsp site usage
[ ] Google analytics - can I back-date clicks?
[ ] Number of pages viewed on restore can be huge (e.g. 308 - must be wrong)
[ ] Force all instruments to be associated with a study/context?
[ ] Restrict ability to launch an instrument based upon authenticated  role (right now, servlet-based, so if know URL, can make it work - how embed login fields without messing up laptop deploy?)
[ ] Should I make multiple anonymous users so have way to restore (e.g. via cookies - sessionID of last session?)

--
7/2/08
--
[ ] Collaborations - just get ArrayList<Study> - possibly sorted
  [ ] add start/end dates?

--
7/3/08
--
[ ] have servlet launcher enforce role-based security?  Does it have an entry point into DataExporter?  No, just the facades (which can be made adequate)
[ ] Logistical Dilemma - must load instrument before can assign it to a study
	[ ] dataExporter.instrumentVersions
[ ] Assining instruments to studies - this can get very complicated
  - Instruments which are private to studies
  - You can only assign instruments to your  own studies
[ ] Lock down permissions on extract_raw_data based upon user permissions (or would it be just instruments assigned to that study)?  - getFinalInstrumentSessionResults()
[ ] Assign study wheen launching instrument - so MUST pass studyId and PersonId through to servlet launcher.
[ ] ListStudies bypasses fine-grained access
[ ] Re-write TricepsServlet as JSP?
  RunInstrument - in-lines all; only problem is that output writer points to wrong path (need  Dialogix.jsp?action=RunInstrument&...).
  May be convenient way to test launch of study or person-specific instances 

--
7/5/08
--
[ ] Any global variables in Schedule which need to be kept could be converted to Bean for easier access
[ ] use templates for Run (e.g. whether to show the question ref, crud, etc.)?
[ ] for local scoping, what is needed?  Item, Value (should data_elemetn contain ID of last item_usage for rapid lookup (findById instead of navigating collection?)
[ ] Re-brand dataExporter as single InstrumentSessionBean?  Would it be better to manage all in scope of a single bean, or have separate backing beans for each?
[ ] Test use of <fmt:> for dealing with localized messages?
[ ] Have question + answerlist be a block so can do colspan?  If so, could assign each to a <div> or jsf column to ensure that all appear aligned?
[ ] Move error messages to SessionBean (for consistent access)?
[ ] Rather than having JSP determine collection based upon language, let sessionBean do so (that way if change model, don't have to re-write them) - advantage of using collection is processing of SQL queries?
[ ] Should all templates be generic - and let determination of whether to show content be based upon item info?  If so, would make template creation easier? - means passing dataExporter too all sub-views, avoiding need to pass param.varName?
[ ] Need way to set _dlxObjects array with all appropriate varNames and types (including submit?) in dialogix_js.jsp
[ ] Note, values and selected notation for input elements MUST be passed from backing-bean - using param won't work for multi-lingual
[ ] What is best way to deal with word-wrap on list and combo-boxes? (requires insertion of additional select elements - like a sub-sub-view?
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" prefix="fmt" %> 
[ ] Show syntax errors as JSP so can do instrument-specific, and read from DB

[ ] How do I ensure that the entities are refreshed?  really want a new pull each time for non-static content (like person sessions)?  Use regular query instead?
[ ] This is also an issue for reviewing data from restored instruments  - may want to switch to JSF-style data providers?
[ ] When restoring, equations appear to be invalid; and reserved words don't seem to be re-loaded
[ ] Person being set for started and restored sessions incorrectly - seems to be suffering from having shared objects across the dataExporter session?

Priorities
[ ] Data load from JAR
[ ] Assess which schedule params should be part of a bean (separate object with OneToOne mapping for easier JSP usasge? - easy to build these days; might be easiest to find/replace in source?
	- LOW PRIORITY until try to replace all in-lined HTML with JSP
  - Evidence.createReserved - maps strings to Values with flag indicating Reserved Index
  - How is use of reserved String mapped to correct data element?
  - Problem is that would need to map from String to Index and use Index in case-statement (rather than String case search?) to map to Bean? (Interface layer)
  - If made that major change, could find and removed all local access to data elements used by Schedule, but since working, may be overkill at this  point
  - If move Reserved Word out of InstrumentVersion (e.g. to StudyInstVer), how should dev vs. production instruments be treated?
[ ] Check restore, esp. equations and 
[ ] Consider new Datum object using data_element.last_item_usage_id.* as source
[ ] Map wave6_users to new model (SQL transformation)
[ ] Consider modeling addition needed parameters (num_errors, status, ...)	

[ ] Error - when going backwards, sets last_item_usage_id - should not for previous, since would overwrite  stored values!
[ ] ERROR - reserved values aren't being passed back to instrument - e.g. restoring developer mode, header, language
