9/25/2007

Re-commented all Evidence code so that only TricepsTimingCalculator is called:

Errors
(1) RawData not updated
(2) EnglishFrenchDemo not updated
(3) InstrumentSession not updated
(4) PageHitEvents - only partially updated
(5) PageHit updated, but wrong times

Instrument_Session_ID is 0 before most errors

Updates do occur (enough? - compare to without comments) - is problem just session ID?

-----
9/26/2007

data.MysqlInstrumentSessionDAO->setInstrumentSession:63 - instrument_id = 0 - is that session? instrument?

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files show proper Unicode (whether using UTF-16 or UTF-8)
(4) .dat.evt are wrong - JavaScript 1.2 (the version I was using) does not support Unicode. When I declare JavaScript 1.5, no change
(5) Need to test Mysql drivers for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
(6) Entering UTF-8 into any input field (text, memo) yields wrong answer.  Unicode in non-text fieds is fine, but may be due to using internal coded values in return statements

Database Writing
- Seems to be largely fixed (no NullPointerException; one row per desired session; updates are happening)
- However, there are many wrong or missing values which need to be corrected
- Make sure to CVS this before doing much more!

Unicode
- UTF-16 to Log4J let me see some contents correctly, confirming that error is not on Log4J side

Notes from running the Gary's revised code

(1) EnglishRussianFrenchHebrew
(2) InstrumentSession
(3) PageHitEvents
(4) PageHits
(5) RawData

-- Note, can't use on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP on two rows, so application must enforce accurate start and end times.
-- N.B.  Focus on InstrumentSession, InstrumentSessionData, and RawData - Ignore PageHits and PageHitEvents for now!!!!

// InstrumentSessionDataDAO
englishrussianfrenchhebrew
  InstrumentName - OK
  InstanceName - OK

// PageHitsDAO (?)
pagehits 
  pageHitID - OK
  instrument_session_id - OK (always 0)	/FIXME
  `timeStamp` - OK
  groupNum - OK	/FIXME (is it really OK?)
  displayNum - OK - at least first several are - accessCount is better	/FIXME
  lastAction - OK (but present)	/skip
  statusMsg - OK
  totalDuration - WRONG (huge)	/FIXME (last entry in EVENT_TIMING)
  serverDuration - WRONG (huge)	/FIXME (computed from TricepsTimingCalculator)
  loadDuration - OK (? - < 100 ms, which seems right)
  networkDuration - ?? (= 0, but working on localhost)	/FIXME (check calculation)
  pageVacillation - WRONG (always 1)	/was this so can do SQL to add # of hits?

// MysqlRawDataDAO
// Set from TTC - exclusively from writeNode?
rawdata 
  RawDataID	- OK
  instrument_session_id - OK
  InstrumentName - OK
  InstanceName - OK
  VarName - OK
  VarNum - BAD - always -1 - but is this really used?	/skip
  GroupNum - OK - it is using DisplayNum	/FIXME (but could be done within InstumentModel on load

  LangNum - OK, but using number from list of languages - should really use the Java ISO code (like "en" or "ru")	/FIXME (from InstrumentLoad)
  WhenAsMS - OK
  `TimeStamp` - OK, but do we really need both (is there an easy conversion between WhenAsMS and TimeStamp
  AnswerType - OK
  Answer - OK, but Unicode part not working.  The NullFlavor part is (*REFUSED*, *UNASKED*, etc.)	/FIXME (Unicode part)
  QuestionAsAsked - OK, but Unicode part not working	/FIXME (unicode part)
  itemVacillation - BAD - always 0	/FIXME - count # change events for a variable within EVENT_TIMING
  responseLatency - BAD - always 0	/FIXME - for a variable, time from focus to next event (as long as next event is not blur)
	// EventAggregate
	// // Evidence - from qtb 
	// PageHitBean (calls EventAggregate - the only function which calls it, via processEvents())
	// QuestionTimingBean (but not used)?
	// TricepsTimingCalculator (using QTB, but not set) (supposed to be?)
	// PageHitBean.processEvents() - it's store() called from TTC
  responseDuration - BAD - always 0	/FIXME - for a variable, time from focus to blur
  nullFlavor - BAD - always 0	/skip
  `Comment` - OK
  <crosspageItemVacillation> - ADD - Assuming have an in-memory representation of data (one row per item), increment it each time an item visited (changed? both?)

[FIXED] Concurrency - when trying to run two simultaneous sessions, they got confused - why?

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files OK
(4) .dat.evt files OK
(5) Entering unicode (Russian, Hebrew) into Dialogix data entry fields yields expected value - SO, Sufficiently working?
(6) Test jar/unjar of data - OK
(7) Test jar/unjar of instruments - BAD - when restore, the character values are wrong (but can avoid this by forcing use of .txt files

---
10/16/2007

Removed obsolete DB access parameters, interfaces and Beans (now 72 files)
Added DisplayNum to InstrumentSession and InstrumentSessionData tables

---
10/17/2007

[DONE] Check workflow - .store() events seem to occur at wrong time.  Page and Instrument should store right before returning to user?
[DONE] Fix lastAccess, statusMsg
[DONE] Confirm using correct GroupNum for pageHits and RawData
[DONE] Fix naming of groups - startingGroup, currentGroup, fromGroup, toGroup
[DONE] Fix naming of end_time => lastAccessTime
[DONE] Test concurrency - OK (as long as separate browsers, and thus separate sessions
[DONE] Removed delete() from all DB calls

	[DONE] Remove InstrumentName from rawData and horizontal table (keep in Instrument)
	[DONE] Remove InstanceName from rawData and horizontal table (keep in Instrument)
	[DONE] Change table names to InstVer_NNNN (rather than  QAM, etc.) (instrumentVersion.instance_table_name)
	[DONE] Convert LangNum to LangCode (see Schedules.languagesISO)
	[DONE] Add LangCode to pageHits, InstrumentSession, HorizontalTable, and RawData to know what to expect

Critical ToDos
==TOM==
[DONE] Finish persisting of full model from DialogixTimingCalculator
  [DONE] Horizontal Table 
  [DONE] DataElement - created, but not updated - do I need to add new objects?  Change persistence type? -- Check that data are being added -- also fix InstrumentContent_ID
  [DONE] PageUsage?
  [DONE] PageUsageEvents?
  [DONE] ItemUsage - fix InstrumentContent_ID
[DONE] Fix uniqueness constraints for Instrument, InstrumentVersion -- Annotate for George
[DONE] Create Inst_Ver_x table wheen upload a new InstrumentVersion (manually roll query) --in ExcelLoader
[DONE] Fix Sequence_Generator so only refers to tables being updated (e.g. remove InstVer4) -- do last 
[DONE] Complete round-trip - upload Excel, collect data - both using JPA -- so populate ItemContents, etc. from Global Definition -- test that can load  instrument and populate DialogixTimingCalculator from InstrumentVersion ID
[ ] Consider re-naming classes?
  - InstrumentContents => Acts
  - ItemType => ActType
  - Item => Act
  - AnswerListContent => AnswerListEntry
[DONE] Re-do Entities to

Test Instruments

== MDS Info
==
(1) On average, there are 2 MDS coordinators per Nursing Home
(2) There are between 16K and 17K nursing homes (was it thousand, or hundred)?
(3) If each coordinator makes $50K, then total cost of that staffing is 30k * 1650 * 2 - so $99 million (or 990 million) spent on that role which could be re-directed to care.

== Notes and ToDos from 11/5/07
==
[ ] Outline Tutorial to identify gaps
 - Identify all use cases I want to show
 - Ensure I cover everything listed in the prospectus
 - Now that I know that Items won't be unique, how do I modify the demo? 
[DONE - see below] Assess what works/doesn't in Dialogix -  esp. re: uniqueness
[DONE] Map  Abt instruments to Dialogix so can load them
[ ] Create DB-free version for uploading and testing.  Once all syntax errors removed, then upload to DB (extract prior version of ExcelLoader as new class)
[ ] Map to XForms?
[ ] Review eDCI model?
[ ] Review ISO 11179 attributes
[ ] Create and test Apelon model
[ ] Verify how will re-import mappings into Dialogix

== NOTES on Import Issues
[DONE] Want to re-use Items - how do I know if it the same as an existing one? - ParseItem passing all needed parameters? -- SKIP- too hard for now
	parseQuestion()?	- need a new ID if none exists; but re-use it if possible
	parseAnswer()? - need a new ID if none exists; but re-use it possible - this assumes that if additional languages are added, the user put thought into proper translation; but this may not be true.
	parseAnswerList() - should be global
	parseItem(Question, ...) - should be global
	parseInstrumentContent() -- NO, these don't need to be unique?
	[ ] Modeling problem - should AnswerListContent be unique, or re-used within AnswerLists?  I can't currently detect unique AnswerLists
	I'm not re-using Items - needs to be fixed, but when?

== Instrument Use - Which fields still aren't being set properly?
InstrumentSession.languageCode
DataElement.languageCode
DataElement.Answer_ID - confirm this.  Seems wrong!!!! 
	- This is critical.  TimingCalculator.FindAnswerID.  Works for English-Hebrew, but not for PHQ - why not?  
	- The raw data is correct, but the mapping to AnswerID is wrong
	- Can this be retrieved from elsewhere?
	- Is it not loading referential integrity of AnswerLists properly?
DataElement.ResponseLatency
DataElement.ResponseDuration
DataElement.DisplayNum (set to 1 for  setting Unasked - those should be 0)
DataElement.NullFlavorID (should be  non-zero for UNASKED)
ItemUsage.ItemVacillation
ItemUsage.ResponseLatency
ItemUsage.ResponseDuration
ItemUsage.Answer_ID -- wrong! but same solution as DataElement
PageUsage.FromGroupNum - always 0
Pageusage.pageDuration
Pageusage.pageVacillation
Pageusage.LanguageCode 
InstrumentSession.LanguageCode

===
AnswerList - what If I add answer_list_denormalized using Dialogix syntax?  [silly, silly, you're doing it!]

NOTES
(1) Throws no errors and does re-use Items, but too many of them (only first AnswerList ever used)
(2) Content appears to be loaded in memory, but not persisted -- are the wrong objects connected?  Is findItem() mis-aligning them?

== Notes from 11/6/07 ==
Action Items
[ ] Add AuthorizedUsers table to Dialogix5


PHP Views
(0) Upload
	- Upload to Dev - do in Velocity or Java Servlet - need code snipped to attach Uploaded file so get filename to submit to Velocity Macro (or InputExcelLoader)
	- Upload to Prod - same, but to database version of Dialogix
(1) Instruments - by title, version - with descriptive statistics.  
	Min = (instrumentHash.numQuestions - instrumentHash.numTailorings); Max = (instrumentHash.numQuestions)
	Name hyperlink - should launch the instrument (look at parser for launch command)

What is lift to replace Datum with Data_Element so that Data_Element is unit of analysis in DialogixParser?

Affected Classes:
AnswerChoice
Datum
DatumMath
Evidence?
Node?
Parser
ParseError?
QSortAlgorithm (not used)
Value?

DialogixParser - what is tightly coupled?
(1) Triceps
(2) triceps.get() -- 3 messages - stack_underflow, undefined_variable, unterminated_escaped_character -- so can modularize this
(3) Datum.getInstance(triceps,Datum.INVALID)	-- do we really need Instance-level creation anymore?  Can't we just set NullFlavorr to INVALID?
(4) triceps.getEvidence().set(String varName, Datum value);	=> pass InstrumentSession to .parse()?  This is TimingCalculator.set(VarName, Data_Element)? - only if can replace Datum with Data_Element
(5) triceps.getEvidence.getDatum(String varName);	=> TimingCalculator. - retrieve DataElement by name
(6) triceps.getEvidence().function(func.image, params, func.beginLine, func.beginColumn)	-- externalize functions?  How?
(7) triceps.getEvidence().getParam(set2.get(i)) -- what does this do? (344) - part of inListOp() - gets data_element, or data_element by name
(8) new Datum(triceps, String value, DataType {String, Number} -- returns a value of type DataType
(9) new Datum(triceps, true) -- returns a Boolean

DatumMath
(1) uses Datum.dateValue(), doubleValue(), booleanValue(), and stringValue() -- so data_element needs those types and options
(2) does not uses triceps.* - so just a pass-through to Datum

Datum
(1) Uses of triceps:  parseNumber(), parseDate(), get({Please_answer_this_question, please_enter_a})
(2) All formatting can be done externally?

Value
- Binds a Node to a Datum

Priorities:
(1) Port Dialogix to J2EE/Oracle so OMH has option to host it
(2) Backup is to have Dialogix hosted (J2EE/MySQL) elsewhere
(3) Start with V1 model, since works.  V6 model is better, but needs more testing
(4) Once have hosting solution (OMH and/or external), migrate current production studies (e.g. CET and Demos) to new platform; at which point can turn-off existing system?
(5) Back-load old data to new site so can fully turn-off/recycle existing hardware
(6) May need minimal management interfaces to ensure  access to data, AppServer, etc. on new platform.
(7) Once OMH has operational system, push forward with Version 6 model, JRuby, etc.


Action Items for George:
(1) Port Dialogix6 (with Dialogix1Model and optionally full Dialogix6 model) to Oracle
	- Works for MySQL
	- Oracle generating some CLOB errors - need to be clear in Entities what type of Lob needed
(2) Port code to J2EE (so can work with Oracle or J2EE) [DONE]
(3) Stress-test the code (memory leaks, concurrency issues, performance)
(Amit) Deploy to OMH servers
(Amit) Stress test with LoadRunner
(Tom) Check acceptability of SAS-based data access vs. Management Layer
(Tom) Present to Chip re suitability for OMH-based data collection -- e.g. screening  instruments, AOT?
(4) Debug Dialogix6 model to ensure successfully and efficiently loads; that InstrumentSessions work; and that no worse for memory leaks, etc.
(5) Explore JRuby as next-generation Front-End
  (a) upload tool
  (b) management layer
(Tom) Get feedback from end-users on needs (e.g. George Musa)

Action Items for Tom
(1) Collect / Clean Wave7 data (Perl) [need to  re-load 12 interviews]
(2) Post AutoPIDS to old server [DONE]
(3) Evaluate Perl for upload to old data model (back-loading  data) [DEFER]
  - should I run Perl against RawData Table (can I extract true TotalDuration, PageDuration, etc. from it?), or re-process raw jar files?
  - will RawData give me AnswerCode and AnswerString?
  - Perl to compute instrument name and version (and MD5 hash) - so can create InstrumentSession table - may want to use Hex MD5 hash rather than Unicode.
  - ? Convert LangNum from integer to 2 char (from whence do I get this?  Full list of instruments? - if so, have to pre-process them
  - Should I try to load instruments into V6 model directly rather than via upload -- NO, but do save as UTF-16
  - make table of instances to convert to InstrumentSessions - there are currently 90,000 instances

(1) Successfully re-added Version 2 data model (e.g. 42 tables), using J2EE
(2) DialogixConstants (renamed to org.dialogix.session.DialogixEntitiesFacade) now works well when all of the em.persist calls are commented out (opposite of our strategy).
(3) The V1 data model works for collecting data
  [ ] -- but RESERVED words are not updated in V1DataElement

(5) Restore is properly retrieving a prior session
(6) Successfully loading any instrument for which V2 database were accurately created.

[ ] Apelon.xml files - they are repeating some entries - e.g. concept answers and associations between the questions and answers
[ ] Refactor all logging?

--
-- 12/11/07
--
[ ] ?Test whether commenting out HashMaps within DialogixEntitiesFacade elmiinates some of the EJB not found exceptions - start getting NonUniqueResult exceptions.  Perhaps if it is Application level
[ ] Test whether should overwrite global variable in DialogixV1TimingCalculator on line 275

Debugging of revampped DialogixTimingCalculator
[ ] responseLatency
[ ] responseDuration
[ ] If *NA*, should QuestionAsAsked be cleared?
[ ] PageUsage.networkDuration - why negative?
[. ] PageUsage.vacillation - why null? What should it be? - because based upon GroupNum (and visits to pageGroup)
[. ] CurrentGroup seems to be CurrentStep -- TRUE  - should we have CurrentStep and CurrentGroup (different restore implications)

	
Should DataElement simply be a pointer to most recent entry in ItemUsage?  If so, then ItemUsage would include *UNASKED*

[DONE] Consolidate Sequence Generator tables
[. ] Set pageVacillation to PageVisit - just use HashMap<String,Integer> of GroupNum

**
[ ] Shouldn't QuestionAsAsked be set BEFORE sending request to user?  This way always capture what was seen on last page by user.  This is then updated with responses.
  [ ] May require an interface at CollectNext Nodes (before WriteNode)
[ ] Add writeReserved
[ ] NullFlavorID set to 1 for *NA* - should be 2?
[. ] pageVisits - Null for "init" - fix this.  Should it start at 0 (being set to 0 at first visit)

[ ] ToGroupNum (SF-36) - initially from -1 to 4, then from 4 to 1 - is it mixing VarNum and GroupNum?
[ ] Copy all instrument files, ensuring that each have title, major & minor version, & list of languages. Keep full path (since can drop full path into LoadExcel.vm)
[ ] Convert all to Excel (write function to load from TSV to Excel and re-save (or load, then pass workbook to LoadExcel?)
[ ] Create DialogixPerl repository on CVS so keep it synced separate from Java

[DONE] Debug AnswerList issue
[ ] Reserved Words?
[ ] Annotate (TODO) other load issues which need to be finalized
[ ] Replace VersionIF and related @@ variables with loadable properties.
