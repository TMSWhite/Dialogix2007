<P>Dr. Cohen-</P>
<P>Dr. Michael Hauan and I are pleased that you have chosen to use our Triceps engine in order to author and implement
the interviews you will be using for your Children in the Community study. This letter outlines the scope of our
collaboration with your group.</P>
<P><B>Scope</B></P>
<P>The use of the Triceps engine, developed by Drs. Hauan and White, by Dr. Cohen's group.</P>

<P><B>Our Role</B></P>
<P>As clinical fellows at PI and in Columbia's Department of Medical Informatics, our role is to conduct research
at the intersection of the medical science, computer science, social science, and political domains. This includes
identifying and evaluating ways in which technology can facilitate and improve the quality of research and medical
care. Our responsibility is to submit papers in both the Informatics domain (e.g. related to the development and
evaluation of theories and tools), and in the Clinical domain (e.g. via collaboration on clinical studies that
are materially benefitted by the use of our theories and tools).</P>
<P>Designing and implementing Triceps was one such project. Triceps is a proof-of-concept, using which we plan
to write a grant to develop a more full fledged system that can be polished for wide-spread use. We are pleased
that even as alpha code, it is able to meet your needs. However, it needs to be clear that Triceps is not a polished
product. Therefore, we are happy to help you use Triceps, as long as the following conditions are understood and
agreed upon.</P>
<P><B>&quot;Guarantees&quot;</B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>Triceps is alpha code. You are free to use Triceps as-is, but we can not provide any warranty implied or otherwise
	<LI>We are confident in the internal workings of Triceps, and have removed all of the bugs we have found.
	<UL>
		<LI>If any bugs are identified, we will fix them as expediently as possible.
	</UL>
</UL>

<P><B>Limitations</B></P>

<UL>
	<LI>Accuracy
	<UL>
		<LI>The accuracy and logical flow of the interview is independent of the Triceps engine, and is the sole responsibility
		of person authoring the interview.
		<UL>
			<LI>We are happy to teach and advise the author, within reason.
			<LI>We have not written, and do not plan to write, a comprehensive instruction or usage manuals
		</UL>
	</UL>
	<LI>Distribution
	<UL>
		<LI>Please do not allow members of your group distribute any copies of Triceps.
		<LI>If anyone outside of your group expresses an interest in using Triceps, please have them contact us directly.
	</UL>
	<LI>Enhancements
	<UL>
		<LI>We are happy to entertain enhancement requests, and will let you use upgrades as they occur. However, if you
		discover that enhancements are needed for your project, we will need to re-negotiate our arrangement.
	</UL>
</UL>

<P><B>Research Assistant</B></P>
<P>We recommend that you will need a FTE research assistant / programmer who would be responsible for the following:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Installation and Maintenance
	<UL>
		<LI>Install Triceps and interview schedules onto the laptops that will be used in the field
		<LI>Install updates / bug-fixes to the schedules, and/or Triceps
		<LI>Retrieve completed interviews from the laptops
		<LI>Synchronize the data with whatever centralized database schema you plan to use
	</UL>
	<LI>Training (of interviewers)
	<UL>
		<LI>How to use the laptops
		<LI>How to navigate through the Triceps &amp; the interviews
		<LI>How to save interviews to floppy disk
		<LI>Basic troubleshooting
		<UL>
			<LI>how to start, suspend, and resume Triceps / interviews in the case of power failures, or other unexpected program
			failures
		</UL>
	</UL>
	<LI>Support
	<UL>
		<LI>Serve as the Help-Desk contact for interviewers, in case they are not able to resolve the problem on their
		own
		<LI>Maintain a log of these calls, which Michael and I will use both to improve Triceps, and also as data for the
		Usability evaluation paper we plan to write
		<LI>Bug tracking?
	</UL>
	<LI>Web Page Design
	<LI>Redesign the web-page look and feel (e.g. logos, colors, fonts, etc.) as necessary (e.g .in response to your
	pilot study recommendations)
	<LI>This will require basic knowledge of HTML and Java, as well as communication with Michael and me to ensure
	that changes to the user interface don't interefere with the core functionality of Triceps (e.g. its ability to
	run the interviews correctly)
</UL>

<P><B>&quot;Emergency Procedures&quot;</B></P>
<P>We also recommend that you have a paper backup solution, in case of untoward events (e.g. any hardware or software
failures that would prevent an interviewer from using Triceps for a given subject). We recommend that you have
procedures in place to either re-schedule interviews in the case of hardware or software failures, and/or enough
copies of paper forms to be able to collect .</P>

<P><B>Paper(s)</B></P>

<P>We feel that the use of Triceps to implement the interviews for the Children in the Community study constitutes
a material contribution that deserves co-authorship on papers published using the data you will be collecting at
this stage.</P>
