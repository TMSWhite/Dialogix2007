Model Changes

Instrument - what other metadata?  From SNOMED?

InstrumentVersion - 
  Status - enum (different steps in development/deployment)?
  
InstrumentTranslation -
  Link to InstrumentContent_ID, not Version (unless duplicate for convenience)
  Would avoid need for (VarNum, VarName, c8name, ActionType, DisplayType)
  
AnswerOptions - normalize these? (really an AnswerList, but Internationalized)
  So extend AnswerListContent to have Translation (or put translation at Q or A)?
	If use canonical strings, do I need MD5 hash?  Just used for tests of identity.
	
InstrumentSession
	Can this be used to preserve state within an running instrument (so navigator would process this)?
	InstrumentVersion would need to load all global definitions;
	InstrumentSession would be used to load all data from RawData and/or structured tables
  Values and importance of last_action, last_access, statusMsg?  Enum lists?
  
PageHit
	Add other convenience keys (instrumentVersion?)
	accessCount - what does this do?
	groupNum - from InstrumentContents? (a static issue)
	lastAction - why?
	statusMsg - why?
	Show activeLanguage?
	
PageHitEvents
	add convenience keys
	Enumerated types for ActionType, EventType?
	How (if at all) are these used?
	
RawData
	add FK to Item global definition (for retrieval) - so can get unparsed question
	which fields are really needed for reporting (vs. can get from Global)
	add FK to Language
	
  
---
Voice - pre-compute all possible strings based upon tailoring text - but only where tailored content comes from enumerated list
Navigation - different interface to let people specify usual branching logic and auto-calculated relevance?
Strings - Consider with/without HTML formatting (for LOINC) and/or SNOMED mapping?
Sections - can/should I do nested sections?
Strings - what about HelpText?  Relevance?  Equations?
Loading data from old files
 - If know variable names, but not attached strings, can I identify instrument?
 - Can processing of instrument data determine which variables are probably tailored? (e.g. no differnce across large sample)
Instrument Identity - how do we make this efficient (#, MD5hash, etc. of contents within existing instruments)?
VariableName
	Should we have a table of these, indexed, to retrieve all data with same Varname?
	Might be better to InstrumentVersion.VarName combined key
Tables to link Q, A, Q+A to CHI
