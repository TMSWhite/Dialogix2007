Re-commented all Evidence code so that only TricepsTimingCalculator is called:

Errors
(1) RawData not updated
(2) EnglishFrenchDemo not updated
(3) InstrumentSession not updated
(4) PageHitEvents - only partially updated
(5) PageHit updated, but wrong times

Instrument_Session_ID is 0 before most errors

Updates do occur (enough? - compare to without comments) - is problem just session ID?

data.MysqlInstrumentSessionDAO->setInstrumentSession:63 - instrument_id = 0 - is that session? instrument?

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files show proper Unicode (whether using UTF-16 or UTF-8)
(4) .dat.evt are wrong - JavaScript 1.2 (the version I was using) does not support Unicode. When I declare JavaScript 1.5, no change
(5) Need to test Mysql drivers for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
(6) Entering UTF-8 into any input field (text, memo) yields wrong answer.  Unicode in non-text fieds is fine, but may be due to using internal coded values in return statements

Database Writing
- Seems to be largely fixed (no NullPointerException; one row per desired session; updates are happening)
- However, there are many wrong or missing values which need to be corrected
- Make sure to CVS this before doing much more!

Unicode
- UTF-16 to Log4J let me see some contents correctly, confirming that error is not on Log4J side

Notes from running the Gary's revised code

(1) EnglishRussianFrenchHebrew
(2) InstrumentSession
(3) PageHitEvents
(4) PageHits
(5) RawData

englishrussianfrenchhebrew
  InstrumentName - OK
  InstanceName - OK
  StartTime - is updated with each insert - so this is actually the EndTime
  end_time - does not change, so this is actually the StartTime
  first_group - OK
  last_group - is properly updated
  last_action - MISSING
  last_access - MISSING
  status_message - MISSING
  instrument_session_id - OK
  <DisplayNum> - Add, so know how far into a given session the user is

instrument_session
  instrument_session_id - OK
  start_time - OK
  end_time - OK
  instrument_id - OK
  instrument_version_id - OK
  user_id - OK (but N/A)
  first_group - OK
  last_group - OK
  last_action - MISSING
  last_access - MISSING
  statusMsg - MISSING
  <DisplayNum> - Add, so know how far into a given session the user is

pagehitevents 
  pageHitEventsID - OK
  pageHitID - OK
  varName - OK
  actionType - OK
  eventType - OK
  `timestamp` - OK
  duration - WRONG (huge)
  value1 - OK
  value2 - OK

pagehits 
  pageHitID - OK
  instrument_session_id - WRONG (always 0)
  `timeStamp` - OK
  accessCount - OK, but how used?
  groupNum - OK
  displayNum - WRONG - at least first several are - accessCount is better
  lastAction - WRONG (but present)
  statusMsg - OK
  totalDuration - WRONG (huge)
  serverDuration - WRONG (huge)
  loadDuration - OK (? - < 100 ms, which seems right)
  networkDuration - ?? (= 0, but working on localhost)
  pageVacillation - WRONG (always 1)

rawdata 
  RawDataID	- OK
  instrument_session_id - OK
  InstrumentName - OK
  InstanceName - OK
  VarName - OK
  VarNum - BAD - always -1 - but is this really used?
  GroupNum - BAD - it is using DisplayNum
  DisplayNum - PARTLY OK - First visible page should have DisplayNum 1, but has 2; from there seems fine 
  LangNum - OK, but using number from list of languages - should really use the Java ISO code (like "en" or "ru")
  WhenAsMS - OK
  `TimeStamp` - OK, but do we really need both (is there an easy conversion between WhenAsMS and TimeStamp
  AnswerType - OK
  Answer - OK, but Unicode part not working.  The NullFlavor part is (*REFUSED*, *UNASKED*, etc.)
  QuestionAsAsked - OK, but Unicode part not working
  itemVacillation - BAD - always 0
  responseLatency - BAD - always 0
  responseDuration - BAD - always 0
  nullFlavor - BAD - always 0
  `Comment` - BAD - they are not being recorded

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files OK
(4) .dat.evt files OK
(5) Entering unicode (Russian, Hebrew) into Dialogix data entry fields yields expected value - SO, Sufficiently working?
(6) Test jar/unjar of data - OK
(7) Test jar/unjar of instruments - BAD - when restore, the character values are wrong (but can avoid this by forcing use of .txt files
[ ] Test Mysql for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
[ ] Log4J not showing unicode?
