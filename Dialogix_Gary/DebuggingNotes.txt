Re-commented all Evidence code so that only TricepsTimingCalculator is called:

Errors
(1) RawData not updated
(2) EnglishFrenchDemo not updated
(3) InstrumentSession not updated
(4) PageHitEvents - only partially updated
(5) PageHit updated, but wrong times

Instrument_Session_ID is 0 before most errors

Updates do occur (enough? - compare to without comments) - is problem just session ID?

data.MysqlInstrumentSessionDAO->setInstrumentSession:63 - instrument_id = 0 - is that session? instrument?

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files show proper Unicode (whether using UTF-16 or UTF-8)
(4) .dat.evt are wrong - JavaScript 1.2 (the version I was using) does not support Unicode. When I declare JavaScript 1.5, no change
(5) Need to test Mysql drivers for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
(6) Entering UTF-8 into any input field (text, memo) yields wrong answer.  Unicode in non-text fieds is fine, but may be due to using internal coded values in return statements

Database Writing
- Seems to be largely fixed (no NullPointerException; one row per desired session; updates are happening)
- However, there are many wrong or missing values which need to be corrected
- Make sure to CVS this before doing much more!

Unicode
- UTF-16 to Log4J let me see some contents correctly, confirming that error is not on Log4J side
