Re-commented all Evidence code so that only TricepsTimingCalculator is called:

Errors
(1) RawData not updated
(2) EnglishFrenchDemo not updated
(3) InstrumentSession not updated
(4) PageHitEvents - only partially updated
(5) PageHit updated, but wrong times

Instrument_Session_ID is 0 before most errors

Updates do occur (enough? - compare to without comments) - is problem just session ID?

data.MysqlInstrumentSessionDAO->setInstrumentSession:63 - instrument_id = 0 - is that session? instrument?

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files show proper Unicode (whether using UTF-16 or UTF-8)
(4) .dat.evt are wrong - JavaScript 1.2 (the version I was using) does not support Unicode. When I declare JavaScript 1.5, no change
(5) Need to test Mysql drivers for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
(6) Entering UTF-8 into any input field (text, memo) yields wrong answer.  Unicode in non-text fieds is fine, but may be due to using internal coded values in return statements

Database Writing
- Seems to be largely fixed (no NullPointerException; one row per desired session; updates are happening)
- However, there are many wrong or missing values which need to be corrected
- Make sure to CVS this before doing much more!

Unicode
- UTF-16 to Log4J let me see some contents correctly, confirming that error is not on Log4J side

Notes from running the Gary's revised code

(1) EnglishRussianFrenchHebrew
(2) InstrumentSession
(3) PageHitEvents
(4) PageHits
(5) RawData

englishrussianfrenchhebrew
  InstrumentName - OK
  InstanceName - OK
  StartTime - is updated with each insert - so this is actually the EndTime
  end_time - does not change, so this is actually the StartTime
  first_group - OK
  last_group - is properly updated
  last_action - MISSING	/skip
  last_access - MISSING	/skip
  status_message - MISSING	/skip
  instrument_session_id - OK
  <DisplayNum> - Add, so know how far into a given session the user is	/FIXME

instrument_session
  instrument_session_id - OK
  start_time - OK
  end_time - OK
  instrument_id - OK
  instrument_version_id - OK
  user_id - OK (but N/A)	/skip
  first_group - OK
  last_group - OK
  last_action - MISSING	/skip
  last_access - MISSING	/skip
  statusMsg - MISSING	/skip
  <DisplayNum> - Add, so know how far into a given session the user is	/FIXME

pagehitevents 
  pageHitEventsID - OK
  pageHitID - OK	/FIXME (seems to be wrong)
  varName - OK
  actionType - OK
  eventType - OK
  `timestamp` - OK
  duration - WRONG (huge)	/FIXME
  value1 - OK
  value2 - OK

pagehits 
  pageHitID - OK
  instrument_session_id - WRONG (always 0)	/FIXME
  `timeStamp` - OK
  accessCount - OK, but how used?	/skip
  groupNum - OK	/FIXME (is it really OK?)
  displayNum - WRONG - at least first several are - accessCount is better	/FIXME
  lastAction - WRONG (but present)	/skip
  statusMsg - OK
  totalDuration - WRONG (huge)	/FIXME (last entry in EVENT_TIMING)
  serverDuration - WRONG (huge)	/FIXME (computed from TricepsTimingCalculator)
  loadDuration - OK (? - < 100 ms, which seems right)
  networkDuration - ?? (= 0, but working on localhost)	/FIXME (check calculation)
  pageVacillation - WRONG (always 1)	/was this so can do SQL to add # of hits?

rawdata 
  RawDataID	- OK
  instrument_session_id - OK
  InstrumentName - OK
  InstanceName - OK
  VarName - OK
  VarNum - BAD - always -1 - but is this really used?	/skip
  GroupNum - BAD - it is using DisplayNum	/FIXME (but could be done within InstumentModel on load
  DisplayNum - PARTLY OK - First visible page should have DisplayNum 1, but has 2; from there seems fine 	/FIXME
  LangNum - OK, but using number from list of languages - should really use the Java ISO code (like "en" or "ru")	/FIXME (from InstrumentLoad)
  WhenAsMS - OK
  `TimeStamp` - OK, but do we really need both (is there an easy conversion between WhenAsMS and TimeStamp
  AnswerType - OK
  Answer - OK, but Unicode part not working.  The NullFlavor part is (*REFUSED*, *UNASKED*, etc.)	/FIXME (Unicode part)
  QuestionAsAsked - OK, but Unicode part not working	/FIXME (unicode part)
  itemVacillation - BAD - always 0	/FIXME - count # change events for a variable within EVENT_TIMING
  responseLatency - BAD - always 0	/FIXME - for a variable, time from focus to next event (as long as next event is not blur)
  responseDuration - BAD - always 0	/FIXME - for a variable, time from focus to blur
  nullFlavor - BAD - always 0	/skip
  `Comment` - BAD - they are not being recorded	/FIXME
  <crosspageItemVacillation> - ADD - Assuming have an in-memory representation of data (one row per item), increment it each time an item visited (changed? both?)

Unicode Debugging Notes
(1) MySQL does accurately store Unicode text (russian, Hebrew) if use PHPMyadmin to enter and save it.  So Mysql will be fine once can load proper data into it.
(2) Velocity Macros also print proper text (so Java Parser is working)
(3) .dat files OK
(4) .dat.evt files OK
(5) Entering unicode (Russian, Hebrew) into Dialogix data entry fields yields expected value - SO, Sufficiently working?
(6) Test jar/unjar of data - OK
(7) Test jar/unjar of instruments - BAD - when restore, the character values are wrong (but can avoid this by forcing use of .txt files
[ ] Test Mysql for unicode compatability (e.g. load results of Velocity Macros into a table
[ ] Log4J not showing unicode?
